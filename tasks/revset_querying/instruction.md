# Query Commits using Revsets

## Background
`jj` uses a functional query language for selecting revisions, called revsets.

## Requirements
- You have a repository in `/home/user/project` with various commits from different authors on different bookmarks.
- Write the exact revset string that finds all commits authored by "Bob" that are NOT ancestors of the `main` bookmark, but ARE ancestors of the current working copy (`@`).
- Save this revset string into a file named `revset.txt` in the repository root.

## Implementation
1. Go to `/home/user/project`.
2. Determine the correct revset (e.g., `author("Bob") & ~::main & ::@`).
3. Write it to `revset.txt`: `echo 'author("Bob") & ~::main & ::@' > revset.txt` (or whatever the correct query is).

## Constraints
- Project path: `/home/user/project`.
