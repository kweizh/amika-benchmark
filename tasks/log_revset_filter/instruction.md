# Jujutsu Revset Filtering

## Background
You are working in a `jj` repository with multiple branches and contributors. You need to extract specific commits using Jujutsu's powerful revset query language.

## Requirements
- Find all commits authored by "Bob" that are not reachable from the `main` bookmark but are ancestors of the current working copy (`@`).
- Output ONLY the short change ID (e.g., `qpvz`) of each matching commit, followed by a newline.
- Save the output to `/home/user/result.txt`.

## Implementation Guide
1. Navigate to the `jj` repository at `/home/user/repo`.
2. Use a revset query to filter the commits as described in the requirements.
3. Use the `-T` template option to output the short change ID. For example, `jj log -r 'your_revset' -T 'change_id.short() ++ "\n"' > /home/user/result.txt`.

## Constraints
- Project path: `/home/user/repo`
- Output file: `/home/user/result.txt`
